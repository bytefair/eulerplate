# Eulerplate, a WordPress theme based on HTML5 Boilerplate

Eulerplate is a WordPress theme meant for people who are learning web design and development and want something clean and easy to start from. Alternately, it's great for people who are making simple, static sites that don't need the advanced blogging features of WordPress and/or control freaks who like to style every last tag by hand.

This theme is built on the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) originally by Paul Irish and Divya Manian. The sole purpose of this theme is to save developers the time it takes to apply the HTML5 Boilerplate to WordPress. The "HTML5 Boilerplate" name is used with permission from Paul Irish.
